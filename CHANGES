====================

Since 0.6.1
-----------
* you have to do
   create_makefile(EXT_NAME)
  at the end of your extconf.rb. This allows you to add mkmf "directives"
  (such as find_library) and to modify the $CFLAGS and other options.
* stub libraries associated to packages (e.g. libcryptokit.a) are linked
  automatically. Note that you will need to use find_library for the libs.
  they link against; for instance, libpcre_stubs.a requires libpcre.so,
  so you have to do something like
    raise "Cannot find PCRE." unless find_library("pcre", "pcre_free")
  before the call to create_makefile.
